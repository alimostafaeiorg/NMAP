Selecting a network interface
Nmap attempts to automatically detect your active network interface; however, 
there are some situations where it will fail or perhaps you will need to select a different interface in order to test networking issues.

----

To force Nmap to scan using a different network interface, use the -e argument:
#nmap -e <interface> <target>
#nmap -e eth2 scanme.nmap.org

This is only necessary if you have problems with broadcast scripts or see the WARNING: Unable to find appropriate interface for system route to message.
