Finding online hosts :
This recipe describes how to determine whether a host is online with Nmap ------>    
#nmap -sn <target>

------


If you have a seeder and want to find the ips that are above: 
#nmap -sn CIDR


------

Tracing routes
Ping scans allow including traceroute information of the targets. Use the Nmap --traceroute option to trace the route from the scanning machine to the target host:

#sudo nmap -sn --traceroute google.com microsoft.com


-------

An interesting NSE script to try when discovering online hosts in networks is the broadcast-ping script, which uses a broadcast ping request to attempt to discover online hosts:
#nmap -sn --script broadcast-ping 192.168.0.1/24
